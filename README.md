The United States Government Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, owns the copyright to the accompanying software under FAR 52.227-14 (c).

This document describes the process by which protein parameters are calculated, involving isoelectric point (pI) and molecular weight (MW). Values are calculated by a BioPerl related script, in a precompute process using GenBank files, and are presented to the user in VIPR. Refer to VIPR_SOP_MW_IP.pdf for additional information.  The Molecular-Weight-IEP was developed by IRD team member Christopher N Larsen, PhD, Anuj Bhatia, and Tom Briggs.
